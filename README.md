# Streamlit Application

Welcome to the **Streamlit Application Project**! This project is a Python-based web application built using the [Streamlit framework](https://streamlit.io/). It is designed to provide an interactive user interface for data visualization, machine learning, or other functionality depending on your specific use case.

## Features
- **Interactive UI**: Create dynamic user interfaces with ease.
- **Data Visualization**: Integrate with libraries like Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn for rich visualizations.
- **User Input**: Collect user inputs using widgets like sliders, text inputs, dropdowns, and more.
- **Responsive Design**: Seamlessly works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Project Structure
The repository contains the following files and directories:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ your_app.py          # Main Streamlit application file
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt     # List of Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                 # Environment variables (if applicable)
â””â”€â”€ README.md            # Project documentation
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jeff-wamugi/FinInsight.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the App
To start the application locally, run the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Deployment
The app can be deployed using various methods:
